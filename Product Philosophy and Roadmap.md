# Roadmap (LIVING DOCUMENT)
The purpose of the document is to share our product philosophy, convey the general direction and priorities of Timeless 1Wallet, and getting community buy-in for the high-level aspects of the plans for the product. Many factors are considered including tradeoffs, cost-benefit, reach, impact, and the effort needed to achieve user delight. 

In this document, you can learn about the key focus areas and the features we’re prioritizing, what stage they’re in, and when (est.) we expect to bring them to the testers and eventually to the larger community.

**NOTE:** The roadmap is a living document that is subject to change based on community feedback. All dates are estimates and new information or events may cause a shift in priorities. 


## Product Philosophy
> _“Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it. They just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while; that’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things.”_ — Steve Jobs  


We’ve learned and “borrowed” liberally from the product frameworks and philosophies from the giants that came before us, and added a few Timeless wrinkles to create our product philosophy in a condensed question format. 

* **How do we 10x the wallet by offering a dramatically better product experience?**
User obsession and user experience above all else. Overdeliver on experience. Place community and the individual users at the center of every product decision.  

* **What new superpower can we give our users?**
Everything we do start with a [‘Why’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA&t=4s). We must first really understand our target demographics (Gen Z / Gen Alpha) and speak their language. What’s their pain point? Articulate Timeless solution that addresses the pain point and give them superpower that is so magical that they want to show all their friends.

* **How do we make social features result in repeat usage?**
We believe _money_ is inherently social. By proxy, this makes wallet social.  The Google’s [toothbrush test](https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/how-google-s-ceo-only-buys-companies-that-pass-his-crazy-toothbrush-test.html) is a great benchmark for any social product. It’s impossible to grab mindshare and create a loyal user base when the users only need to use the product occasionally. As such, it is imperative that every feature satisfies the toothbrush test where all new products and features must be fun and/or important enough that people will use them at least twice a day.

* **50% emotional; 50% rational**. Rather than solely focusing on product features that users _need_, how do features make the user _feel_?

* **What is a realistic, narrow, time window to roll out the feature given the [constraint](https://uxdesign.cc/creative-constraints-how-limitations-can-fuel-creativity-de3ef1e441b8)?**
Building a proper cadence across varying product functions (design, development, testing) is absolutely critical in building a sustainable product free of wild ebbs and flows.

## Release phases
Release phases indicate the stages that the product goes through, from early [fishfood](https://www.notion.so/Fishfooding-1Wallet-26a6863143e24e018f6d5af5e82a880c)/dogfooding alpha to public beta to general availability.

* **alpha:** _Primarily for “internal” testing and feedback_
Limited availability. Features are still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use.
* **beta:** _Publicly available in some capacity_
Features mostly complete and documented. Min. soak time of 1-2 quarters before GA.
* **ga:** _Generally available to all users_
Ready for production use through App Store (iOS). 

Given the nascency of development, many of the features are in the exploratory stages and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows:

* **in design:**
Feature in discovery phase. Decision is made to build out the feature but the spec and design have not yet been finalized.

* **exploring:**
Feature under consideration. No decision is yet made on the feature and the team is gathering feedback on the go/no-go.

## Roadmap stages
**[Post Open Source — add a link to the board]** The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. The roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline.
